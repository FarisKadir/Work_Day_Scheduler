# Work_Day_Scheduler


## Description

This is a single day work scheduled I created. It uses the the bootstrap css framework, moment.js library, jquery / javascript, and html. It is able to store entries into local storage and help you keep track of your day to day schedule.


## User Story

```

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
